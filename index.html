      <p><img id="mypicture" src="./Assets/images/batman.jpg" alt="picture of me">Samantha Flores, up and coming hopeful keyboard maestro, graduated from LMU with a BS in Biology in May of 2014. Since then, she has been a lab quality tester for things as diverse as flavorings for your favorite foods, nutritional supplements to help you live a healthier life, and medical devices that are used daily to save lives. She's coming back for another round of schooling because of her lifelong desire to learn and her interest in the future and technology. While she briefly considered minoring in Computer Science in college, most of this information is new to her.

      <p>Samantha prefers to be called Sam or Sammi--Samantha makes her feel like she's in trouble for something. Sam is
        a lover of coffee, books, superheroes, and science, in aproximately that order. She'll take her coffee almost
        any way you serve it, as long as there's a lot of it. You don't want to see her without her daily caffeine fix.
        In terms of books, Sammi will read almost anything--she read 32 last year alone from a wide variety of genres
        and authors and is always looking for recommendations. Robin and Batman are her favorite superheroes, in that
        order. If given the chance, she wouold run away to be the next Robin. Science will always be here favorite
        subject, but she's hoping to find a new passion for web development after taking this class.
